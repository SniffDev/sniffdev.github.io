# Free, open-source apps you should use
**This page is a work-in-progress, there are things that aren't done yet, and other things may be broken.

**Hi!**

This is a **hand-crafted** collection of *completely free*, open-source programs I think could be useful to most users, **in no particular order.** Some of these apps, that connect to other proprietary servers, are also **privacy-focused**, meaning they do their best to keep you as *anonymous* as possible when using them, as well as completely removing **advertising** and **sponsorships** in the process.

If you'd like to contribute to any of these projects or download pre-release builds to check out new features, check out my **[GitHub list](https://github.com/stars/SniffDev/lists/foss-you-should-use)** this webpage is based on!

 **Brave** is a privacy-oriented browser with integrated **AdBlock** and **tracking blocking** by default, although you can enable things like *full Javascript blocking* on its settings. It has lots of customization and doesn't even require an **account!** It's also possible to import your bookmarked sites and settings from other browsers to make the switch easier. I use it on a daily basis and I think it's the best browser out there.

 Brave also features a **cryptocurrency** system based on viewing Brave-exclusive ads and paying the creators of your favorite sites back. I have it all disabled so I can't judge or praise it too much.
