# Free, open-source apps you should use
**This page is a work-in-progress, there are things that aren't done yet, and other things may be broken.**

**Hi!**

This is a collection of *completely free, open-source* programs I think could be useful to most users, **in no particular order.** Some of these apps, that make use of other proprietary services, are also **privacy-focused**, do their best to keep you as *anonymous* as possible when using them, as well as completely removing **advertising** in the process.

*Unless otherwise specified, all of these programs are **only** designed for desktop environments.*

If you'd like to contribute to any of these projects or download pre-release builds to check out new features, check out my **[GitHub list](https://github.com/stars/SniffDev/lists/foss-you-should-use)** this webpage is based on!

## Internet/Internet Services

 ### Brave Browser

 <sub>***Available for both mobile and desktop environments with minor version differences.***</sub>

 [Official site](https://brave.com) / [VirusTotal link](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/url/9f119e082bdda57b4d98204db217fe50f001a5ee7e588a0f8cdd776d698865f5)

 The internet is a sea of ads, hackers, and echo chambers. Big Tech makes huge profits off our data, and tells us what’s true and what’s not. Brave is fighting back.

 Brave is on a mission to protect your privacy online. We make a suite of internet privacy tools—including our **browser** and **search engine**—that shield you from the ads, trackers, and other creepy stuff trying to follow you across the web.

 50 million people have already switched to Brave for a faster, more private web. Hundreds of thousands more sign up every day. **It only takes 60 seconds to switch**.

 *Think switching is a hassle? It’s not. With Brave, you can easily import bookmarks, extensions, even saved passwords from your old browser. It’s just one click in onboarding. Or download and **import later**.*


 ### NewPipe

 <sub>***Only available for mobile devices.***</sub>

 [Official site](https://newpipe.net) / [VirusTotal link](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/url/5c7d75da5ee1eb3357184a089a3ef490b43a6338dc88213b1f0d187bd0c68b5c)

 "**A libre lightweight streaming front-end for Android.**"

 "NewPipe works by fetching the required data from the official API (e.g. PeerTube) of the service you're using. If the official API is restricted (e.g. YouTube) for our purposes, or is proprietary, the app parses the website or uses an internal API instead. This means that you don't need an account on any service to use NewPipe.

Also, since they are free and open source software, neither the app nor the Extractor use any proprietary libraries or frameworks, such as Google Play Services. This means you can use NewPipe on devices or custom ROMs that do not have Google apps installed."
