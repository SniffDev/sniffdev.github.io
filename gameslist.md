# Games you should try
**Hi!**

This is a hand-crafted list of my favorite games to date, **in no order in particular.** All games are available through **[Steam.](https://store.steampowered.com/)** I cannot guarantee they are available on other gaming platforms.

All games are also decently priced, none costs much more than *around 20 USD$*, but there may be exceptions.
